## Key Features of DBMS

- **Data modeling:** A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships of the data in a database
- **Data storage and retrievel:** A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for searching and quering the data.
- **Concurrency control:** A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other.
- **Data integrity and security:** A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data.
- Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.

 

### DBMS can be classified into two types:

- Relational Database Management System(RDBMS)
- Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)

RDBMS: Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns.  The data are related to each other through primary and foreign keys.

No SQL:  Data is organized in the form of key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-based.  These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance scenarios.

 

## Database Languages

- Data Definition Language
- Data Manipulation Language
- Data Controll Language
- Transactional Control Language

## Data Definition Language

which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.
